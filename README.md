Using the framework provided by rlbot.org, I am engineering an artificial intelligence algorithm for the video game Rocket League.

The goal I initially set was to beat the Psyonix All-Star Bots (the best bots that the game natively provides). After about a week of programming my bot, I accomplished this goal.

This has been one of my favorite projects because I am a big fan of Rocket League, and I also love to code. It has been a pleasure to unite the two interests.
