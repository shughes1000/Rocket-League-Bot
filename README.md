Using the framework provided by rlbot.org, I am engineering an artificial intelligence algorithm for the video game Rocket League.

The goal I initially set was to beat the Psyonix All-Star Bots (the best bots that the game natively provides). After about a week of programming my bot, I accomplished this goal.

Due to the nature of the project, I plan on improving the bot until I discover a new approach that warrants creating a new bot altogether. Until then, I will continue to update my code.

This has been one of my favorite projects because I am a big fan of the video game Rocket League and I also love to code. It has been a pleasure to unite the two interests.
